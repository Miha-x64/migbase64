This library is clone of http://migbase64.sourceforge.net/ project. It has been cloned here in github for following reasons.

* To Manvanify the project
* To Sync the artifacts to Maven Central

Other than, code/tests are exactly same as original repository and same BSD license applies here as well. 
Full copyright of this library belongs to Mikael Grev.

To include this library, add following dependency. You can also add this using m2e artifact search.

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.brsanthu</groupId>
			<artifactId>migbase64</artifactId>
			<version>2.2</version>
		</dependency>

If you have any questions or issues, I would recommend you create an issue in sourceforce at http://sourceforge.net/p/migbase64/feature-requests/

As groupId, I would have preferred to use migcomponents.com (due to http://www.migcomponents.com) but decided to use my own groupId brsanthu.com 
just so I can easily release artifacts into Maven Central using my existing account at https://oss.sonatype.org.
